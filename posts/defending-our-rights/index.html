For many of us, who have dedicated the past few years to pursuing our education here, meeting this demand is simply impossible. My own academic journey spans two years, leaving me with only three years available for work. This move has provoked a collective outrage from all of us who are directly affected. It is a stark reminder that the government seems to be completely ignoring us.\nThis article was written on April 22nd: As an international student deeply invested in the future of our province, I am deeply concerned about the discussions surrounding potential government decisions that may prioritize workers from other provinces over local students like me. Despite our significant investments in education and our desire to contribute to the local society and economy, we fear being marginalized and disregarded by these potential policies.\nMoreover, it is crucial to note that the nature and objectives of previous protests have been manipulated and misrepresented by certain representatives. We feel exploited and deceived by these actions, as our genuine concerns have been overshadowed and our demands have been misrepresented. As a participant in the two-year Red River College program, I am theoretically less affected by policy changes. However, I believe it is imperative to stand up and advocate for my rights. Specifically, the potential decision to conduct NOC-based draws has particularly intensified our discontent, as we strongly oppose this approach.\nIn response to these concerns, we are protesting today peacefully to express our apprehensions and demand fair treatment for local international students in any future immigration policies. Our protest aims to highlight the importance of recognizing and supporting international students who choose MB as their first destination.\n","wordCount":"306","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Zhiyu"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://zgu2ca.github.io/posts/defending-our-rights/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Zhiyu","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://zgu2ca.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://zgu2ca.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Zhiyu (Alt + H)">Zhiyu</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Defending Our Rights</h1><div class=post-description>International Students Advocate for Fair Treatment</div><div class=post-meta>Zhiyu</div></header><div class=post-content><p><strong>Updated on April 24rd</strong>: Today&rsquo;s Expression of Interest Draw #215, demanding at least 4 years of work experience in the past five years, further exacerbates our already dire situation.
